# Makeup Ng App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

This project has was created in order to practice use of the Angular 8 framework as well as use of APIs after a week of learning about angular. 

The project will call the [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) and use this to display information on brands and products as well as filtering these based on search crieria and being able to store products to favourites. Once this basis is completed, other APIs will be used in conjunction in to order to demonstrate further use of how to combine data and dynamically create components and functionality. 

The project is currently a work in progress.
